    <td>The year is 1914. America is entrenched in World War One, and you've managed to get your hands on an intercepted message from the Germans. It's been heavily encrypted, but as America's finest cryptographer of the era, you feel up to the challenge. You know this cipher is the one the French call Ubchi, and that the same keyword has been applied twice. You don't know what the keyword it, however it shouldn't be any longer than 15 characters.</td>

    <td><a href="https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2013-crypto-500">2013-crypto-500</a></td>
    <td>The year is 1972, and as an official of the US government it's come to your attention that a new standard for classified information is needed in this modern day and age. In the past, cryptography has worked well, no ciphers currently exist that would be suitable for this task, however a new cipher has just been proposed by IBM and it's up to you to try to crack their message. You know that they used a weak keyword consisting of 4 pairs of 2 letters each (e.g. 'AeAeAeAe') as well as a weak encryption method, the electronic codebook. Since IBM's cipher relies on a certain number of rounds, you also know that they could be using anywhere from 10 to 50 rounds. Everyone's counting on you to give an answer on whether or not this cipher is a good fit for the government. Good Luck.</td>
